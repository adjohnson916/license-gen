Just in dev now. Temporary only one way is avalible :P


# license-gen

type some command to generate a LICENSE file for your project.


# Quick Start

```sh
$ npm install -g license-gen
```

```
cd /path/to/yourproject
license-gen LICENSE_TYPE
```

# Advance

```
$ license-gen -a YOURNAME -y YEAR -p PROJECT LINCESE
```

# In the future.

* interactive dialog for choosing license type, if you don't know which one to use.
* any numbers of arguments will work, default value will come from your configs.
* append the README file, add license note to the end of the file.
* much more... I think. :P
